It is the instantaneous rate calculated over a time period and this rate is considered constant. It can also be considered as the risk of experiencing the event of interest at time t. It is the number of subjects experiencing an event in the interval beginning at time t divided by the product of the number of subjects surviving at time t and interval width. Since the probability of a continuous random variable to equal a particular value is zero. That’s why we consider the probability of the event happening at a particular interval of time from T till $(T + \\Delta T)$. Since our goal is to find the risk of an event and we don’t want the risk to get bigger as the time interval $\\Delta T$ gets bigger. Thus, in order to adjust for that, we divide the equation by $\\Delta T$. This scales the equation by $\\Delta T$.

It is based on very small intervals of time, which contains at most one event of interest. It is a semi-parametric approach for the estimation of weights in a Proportional Hazard Model. The parameter estimates are obtained by maximizing the partial likelihood of the weights. Gradient Descent is used to fit the Cox Model to the data. The explanation of Gradient Descent finds the weights such that the error is minimized. The formula for the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model is given as follows.

A change in these regression coefficients or covariates will either increase or decrease the baseline hazard. A positive sign for $b_i$ means that the risk of an event is higher, and thus the probability for the event of interest for that particular subject is higher. Similarly, a negative sign means that the risk of the event is lower. Also, note that the magnitude, i.e the value itself plays a role as well. For example, for the value of a variable equaling to one would mean that it’ll have no effect on the Hazard. For a value less than one, it’ll reduce the Hazard and for a value greater than one, it’ll increase the Hazard. These regression coefficients, $b$, are estimated by maximizing the partial likelihood.</font></div>\n<br>\n<div align='justify'><font size=3>Cox Proportional Hazards Model is a <font color ='#ff4f4f'>semi-parametric model</font> in the sense that the baseline hazard function does not have to be specified i.e it can vary, allowing a different parameter to be used for each unique survival time. But, it assumes that the rate ratio remains proportional throughout the studied period. This results in increased flexibility of the model. A fully-parametric proportional hazards model also assumes that the baseline hazard function can be parameterized according to a particular model for the distribution of the survival times.
